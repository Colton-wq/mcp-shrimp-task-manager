âš¡ Parallel Task Execution - Maximize AI Efficiency

One of the most powerful features I've added is the ability to run multiple AI agents simultaneously on independent tasks. Here's how it works:

The task table includes a Dependencies column that reveals which tasks can be executed in parallel. When a task has no dependencies, it becomes a candidate for parallel execution - meaning you can have multiple Claude sessions working on different tasks at the same time.

To facilitate this, I've added a robot emoji (ðŸ¤–) in the Tasks column. With a single click, it copies a specialized instruction to your clipboard that you can paste into a new Claude Code session. This instruction automatically:

â€¢ Assigns the correct specialized agent for that specific task
â€¢ References the exact task UUID from SHRIMP Task Manager
â€¢ Includes commands to mark the task as "in progress" when work begins
â€¢ Ensures proper task tracking across parallel sessions

For example, clicking the robot emoji generates something like:
"use the built in subagent located in ./claude/agents/backend-specialist.md to complete this shrimp task: 5d0cfabe-7fad-414c-90ed-2f040b7f8cf2 please when u start working mark the shrimp task as in progress"

This means you can have one Claude session working on frontend tasks while another handles backend implementation, and a third tackles documentation - all coordinated through the visual interface. This parallel execution capability can reduce development time by 3-5x for complex projects with multiple independent components.
