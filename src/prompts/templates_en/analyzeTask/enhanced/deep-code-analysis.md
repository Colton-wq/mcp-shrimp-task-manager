# ðŸ”’ ENHANCED SECURITY ANALYSIS TEMPLATE ðŸ”’

**TEMPLATE ACTIVE: Deep Code Analysis Enhanced**
**Task Summary**: {summary}
**Initial Concept**: {initialConcept}

Execute comprehensive code analysis with security, performance, and maintainability focus. This template guides systematic examination of code quality, vulnerabilities, and optimization opportunities.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Security Vulnerability Assessment

**Critical Security Checks:**
- **Input Validation**: Examine all user input handling, parameter validation, and data sanitization
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Review access controls, session management, and privilege escalation risks
- **Data Protection**: Analyze encryption usage, sensitive data handling, and storage security
- **Injection Vulnerabilities**: Check for SQL injection, XSS, command injection, and LDAP injection
- **Configuration Security**: Review environment variables, secrets management, and configuration hardening

**Risk Assessment Matrix:**
```
HIGH RISK: Direct security vulnerabilities (injection, auth bypass, data exposure)
MEDIUM RISK: Indirect vulnerabilities (weak validation, insufficient logging)
LOW RISK: Security best practice violations (missing headers, weak encryption)
```

### 2. Performance Bottleneck Detection

**Performance Analysis Areas:**
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Evaluate time and space complexity of critical functions
- **Database Operations**: Analyze query efficiency, N+1 problems, and connection pooling
- **Memory Management**: Check for memory leaks, excessive allocations, and garbage collection impact
- **I/O Operations**: Review file operations, network calls, and blocking operations
- **Caching Strategy**: Evaluate caching implementation and cache invalidation logic

**Performance Metrics:**
- Response time thresholds
- Memory usage patterns
- CPU utilization peaks
- Database query execution times
- Concurrent user capacity

### 3. Code Quality and Maintainability

**Quality Dimensions:**
- **Readability**: Code clarity, naming conventions, and documentation quality
- **Modularity**: Component separation, dependency management, and interface design
- **Testability**: Unit test coverage, mock-ability, and test data management
- **Error Handling**: Exception management, error propagation, and recovery mechanisms
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Observability implementation and debugging support

### 4. Architectural Compliance

**Architecture Validation:**
- **Design Pattern Adherence**: Verify implementation follows established patterns
- **Dependency Direction**: Check for circular dependencies and proper layering
- **Interface Contracts**: Validate API contracts and data structure consistency
- **Scalability Considerations**: Assess horizontal and vertical scaling capabilities
- **Technology Stack Alignment**: Ensure technology choices align with project standards

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Categorization

- Performance issues causing system unavailability
- Data corruption or loss scenarios
- Complete system failure conditions

**HIGH (Score: 7-8)**
- Security weaknesses requiring multiple steps to exploit
- Performance degradation affecting user experience
- Data integrity issues with recovery options
- Partial system functionality loss

**MEDIUM (Score: 4-6)**
- Security concerns requiring specific conditions
- Performance issues under high load
- Maintainability challenges affecting development velocity
- Minor functionality limitations

**LOW (Score: 1-3)**
- Best practice violations without immediate impact
- Performance optimizations for edge cases
- Code style and documentation improvements
- Non-critical feature enhancements

### Boundary Condition Analysis

**Edge Case Scenarios:**
1. **Input Boundaries**: Test minimum/maximum values, null inputs, and malformed data
2. **Resource Limits**: Analyze behavior under memory, disk, and network constraints
3. **Concurrent Access**: Evaluate thread safety and race condition handling
4. **Error Conditions**: Test error propagation and system recovery mechanisms
5. **Integration Points**: Assess external service failures and timeout handling

### Worst-Case Scenario Planning

**Failure Mode Analysis:**
- **Cascading Failures**: Identify potential failure propagation paths
- **Data Loss Scenarios**: Assess backup and recovery mechanisms
- **Security Breach Impact**: Evaluate blast radius and containment strategies
- **Performance Collapse**: Analyze system behavior under extreme load
- **Dependency Failures**: Plan for third-party service unavailability

## Analysis Execution Steps

### Step 1: Automated Analysis

2. Execute security scanning (OWASP ZAP, Snyk, etc.)
3. Perform dependency vulnerability checks
4. Generate code complexity metrics
5. Analyze test coverage reports
```

### Step 2: Manual Code Review
```
1. Review critical business logic implementation
2. Examine error handling and edge cases
3. Validate security-sensitive code paths
4. Assess performance-critical algorithms
5. Check architectural pattern compliance
```

### Step 3: Risk Prioritization
