**Load Testing Scenarios:**
```
NORMAL LOAD: Expected production traffic patterns
PEAK LOAD: Maximum anticipated traffic (2-3x normal)
STRESS LOAD: Beyond peak capacity to identify breaking points
SPIKE LOAD: Sudden traffic increases to test elasticity

```

### 4. Performance Degradation Pattern Analysis

**Degradation Triggers:**

- **External Dependencies**: Third-party service performance impact

**Performance Regression Detection:**
```
IMMEDIATE REGRESSION: Performance drop after specific changes
GRADUAL DEGRADATION: Slow performance decline over time
PERIODIC DEGRADATION: Cyclical performance issues
THRESHOLD BREACHES: Performance falling below acceptable limits
CASCADING DEGRADATION: Performance issues spreading across components
```

### 5. Capacity Planning and Forecasting
