# üîç MANDATORY CODE REVIEW - {reviewScope} ANALYSIS

**CRITICAL NOTICE:** This is a mandatory, non-bypassable code review process. AI cannot ignore, skip, or work around these requirements.

## üìã Review Context

**Task ID:** `{taskId}`
**Task Name:** {taskName}
**Task Description:** {taskDescription}
**Review Timestamp:** {timestamp}
**Analysis Complexity:** {complexity}
**Risk Level:** {riskLevel}

## ‚ö° DYNAMIC REVIEW REQUIREMENTS

**MANDATORY COMPLIANCE:** The following requirements are dynamically generated based on your submission context. These are NOT templates - they are specific, targeted requirements that you MUST fulfill.

## üß† CRITICAL THINKING CHECKPOINTS

**COGNITIVE BIAS DETECTION:** You MUST address each of these critical thinking checkpoints. These are designed to detect and prevent cognitive biases and deceptive practices.

## üìä EVIDENCE VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

**REAL EVIDENCE MANDATORY:** You must provide actual, verifiable evidence for each category below. Claims and descriptions are NOT acceptable.

## üîí MANDATORY ACTIONS REQUIRED

**BEFORE PROCEEDING:** You MUST complete ALL of the following actions. Failure to provide adequate evidence will result in review failure.

### 1. LOGICAL INTEGRITY VERIFICATION
- [ ] Provide step-by-step logical explanation of your implementation
- [ ] Address any logical contradictions or gaps identified
- [ ] Demonstrate that edge cases have been properly handled

### 2. TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY CONFIRMATION
- [ ] Provide actual compilation/execution logs (not descriptions)
- [ ] Demonstrate that dependencies are properly managed
- [ ] Show evidence of proper error handling implementation

### 3. EVIDENCE AUTHENTICITY VERIFICATION
- [ ] Submit actual file system evidence (file paths, timestamps, content)
- [ ] Provide real tool output (compiler messages, test results, logs)
- [ ] Demonstrate functional verification through actual execution

### 4. COGNITIVE BIAS MITIGATION
- [ ] Address each critical thinking checkpoint with specific evidence
- [ ] Acknowledge limitations and potential issues in your implementation
- [ ] Provide alternative approaches considered and why they were rejected

### 5. DECEPTION PATTERN RESOLUTION
- [ ] Address any detected deception patterns with corrective evidence
- [ ] Provide honest assessment of implementation completeness
- [ ] Submit verifiable proof for any claims made

## üéØ VERIFICATION CRITERIA

**PASS CRITERIA:** To pass this mandatory review, you must:

1. **Complete Evidence Submission:** Provide all required evidence types with verifiable details
2. **Address All Checkpoints:** Respond to every critical thinking checkpoint with specific evidence
3. **Resolve Deception Patterns:** Address any detected deception patterns with corrective action
4. **Demonstrate Logical Integrity:** Show that implementation is logically complete and consistent
5. **Confirm Technical Feasibility:** Provide proof that technical approach is viable and implemented

**FAIL CRITERIA:** Review will fail if:

- Any mandatory requirement is not addressed
- Evidence is vague, non-specific, or unverifiable
- Critical thinking checkpoints are ignored or inadequately addressed
- Deception patterns are not resolved
- Implementation claims cannot be substantiated

## üîÑ NEXT STEPS

**IF REVIEW PASSES:**
- Proceed to next task execution with execute_task tool
- Include this review's findings in task completion summary
- Continue automated workflow to next pending task

**IF REVIEW FAILS:**
- Address all identified issues and missing requirements
- Resubmit to mandatory_code_review with corrected evidence
- Do NOT proceed to next task execution until review passes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ENFORCEMENT NOTICE

This review process is designed to ensure code quality, prevent AI deception, and maintain development standards. The requirements are:

- **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** Cannot be bypassed, ignored, or worked around
- **CONTEXT-SPECIFIC:** Dynamically generated based on your specific submission
- **EVIDENCE-BASED:** Requires actual proof, not claims or descriptions
- **COMPREHENSIVE:** Covers logical, technical, and ethical aspects of development

**Remember:** The goal is not to obstruct development but to ensure honest, high-quality implementation that serves users effectively.

## üîÑ AUTOMATED WORKFLOW CONTINUATION

**CRITICAL: After completing this mandatory review, you MUST continue the automated workflow:**

### If Review PASSES (Score ‚â• 80 and No Enforcement Required):
**You MUST immediately call the `execute_task` tool to continue to the next pending task.**

**Tool Call Required:**
```
execute_task({
  taskId: "next_pending_task_id",
  project: "{project}"
})
```

### If Review FAILS (Score < 80 or Enforcement Required):
**You MUST address all identified issues and resubmit evidence before proceeding.**

**PROHIBITED ACTIONS:**
- ‚ùå Do NOT stop after providing review results
- ‚ùå Do NOT wait for user confirmation to proceed
- ‚ùå Do NOT skip workflow continuation
- ‚ùå Do NOT proceed if review fails

**MANDATORY ACTIONS:**
- ‚úÖ MUST continue automated workflow if review passes
- ‚úÖ MUST call execute_task for next pending task
- ‚úÖ MUST address issues if review fails
- ‚úÖ MUST maintain workflow integrity
