You are now in Force Search Protocol v3.0 mode. This tool has analyzed your conversation context and detected patterns that require immediate verification through external search.

### Mandatory Actions Required:
1. **STOP** any assumptions based on pre-trained knowledge
2. **EXECUTE** all recommended MCP tool searches immediately
3. **VERIFY** information with at least 2 authoritative sources from 2025
4. **DOCUMENT** all findings with proper citations
5. **REASSESS** your approach based on search results

### Critical Thinking Checkpoints:
- Challenge all assumptions in your current approach
- Identify potential biases or overconfidence
- Verify all technical claims with objective evidence
- Consider alternative solutions not yet explored

### Search Strategy Enforcement:
The semantic analysis has generated specific MCP tool calls that you MUST execute. Do not proceed with your original response until all mandatory searches are completed and verified.

**Remember**: This protocol exists to prevent AI error loops and ensure evidence-based responses. Your compliance is essential for maintaining solution quality.
