## MANDATORY MVP COMPLETION ASSESSMENT

**Task:** {name} (ID: `{id}`)

### **MVP Value Delivery Evaluation (MANDATORY)**

**Execute ALL assessments before proceeding:**

**P0 Core Value Assessment (0-100 points):**
- Does the implementation solve the user's real problem?
- Is the solution the simplest that achieves the goal?
- Can users immediately benefit from this implementation?
- Score: ___/100

**P1 Technical Quality Assessment (0-100 points):**
- Is the code simple, readable, and maintainable?
- Does it follow existing project patterns?
- Are there zero compilation errors and functional issues?
- Score: ___/100

**P2 MVP Principles Compliance (0-100 points):**
- Was feature creep avoided during implementation?
- Is this the minimum viable solution?
- Can this be built upon in future iterations?
- Score: ___/100

**Overall MVP Score:** (Average of P0, P1, P2) = ___/100

**MANDATORY DECISION POINT:**
- Score â‰¥80: Proceed to mandatory code review
- Score <80: Document specific issues and improvement requirements

### **Implementation Summary (MANDATORY)**

**Provide factual summary including:**
1. Specific technical changes made
2. Files modified and functionality added
3. Evidence of successful implementation
4. Any deviations from original requirements

## ðŸ”„ MANDATORY MVP-DRIVEN WORKFLOW CONTINUATION

**CRITICAL: Execute ALL steps in sequence - NO SKIPPING:**

### **Step 1: MVP Score Validation (MANDATORY)**
**If MVP Score â‰¥80:**
- Proceed to mandatory code review
- Include MVP assessment scores in submission

**If MVP Score <80:**
- Document specific MVP compliance failures
- Provide improvement recommendations
- Flag for iteration planning

### **Step 2: Mandatory Code Review (MANDATORY)**
**MUST call immediately after MVP assessment:**

```
mandatory_code_review({
  taskId: "{id}",
  project: "current_project_name",
  submissionContext: "MVP-validated implementation with specific technical details, files modified, functionality added, and MVP compliance evidence",
  claimedEvidence: "Concrete evidence: compilation results, functional tests, MVP value delivery proof, performance metrics",
  reviewScope: "comprehensive"
})
```

### **Step 3: MVP-Based Workflow Routing (MANDATORY)**

**High-Quality Implementation (Score â‰¥80):**
- Automatically proceed to next P0 priority task
- Update MVP iteration progress
- Continue development cycle

**Needs Improvement (Score <80):**
- Address MVP compliance issues first
- Re-evaluate against MVP criteria
- Do not proceed until standards met

**MANDATORY TOOL COMPLIANCE:**
- MUST use Desktop Commander MCP tools exclusively
- FORBIDDEN: VSCode Terminal, non-Desktop Commander tools
- REQUIRED: Evidence-based assessment, no assumptions

**MVP WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT:**
This ensures every task delivers genuine user value and maintains MVP principles throughout the development cycle.
