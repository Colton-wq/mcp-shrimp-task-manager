Conduct critical analysis of conversation context to detect AI behavior patterns that indicate reliance on pre-trained knowledge or problematic reasoning approaches. This tool performs semantic analysis of dialogue content and generates mandatory search strategies when risky patterns are detected.

**MANDATORY USAGE RULES:**
1. Call this tool IMMEDIATELY when you detect uncertainty in your own responses
2. REQUIRED before providing any technical solution without recent verification
3. MANDATORY when the same approach fails multiple times
4. MUST be used when discussing rapidly evolving technologies (AI, frameworks, APIs)
5. REQUIRED when you catch yourself using phrases like "typically", "usually", "should work"

**CRITICAL WARNING**: This tool enforces evidence-based responses. When high-risk patterns are detected, you MUST complete all recommended MCP tool searches before proceeding. Failure to follow search recommendations violates the Force Search Protocol v3.0.

**DETECTION TARGETS:**
- Overconfident expressions: "perfectly fine", "no problems", "simple fix"
- Uncertainty patterns: "I think", "probably", "based on my knowledge"  
- Error persistence: continuing failed approaches without verification
- Oversimplification: reducing complex technical issues to trivial solutions
