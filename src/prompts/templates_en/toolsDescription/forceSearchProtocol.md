Analyze conversation context to detect AI behavior patterns indicating reliance on pre-trained knowledge or problematic reasoning approaches. Generate mandatory search strategies when risky patterns are detected to enforce evidence-based responses.

Detect overconfident expressions, uncertainty patterns, error persistence, and oversimplification in AI responses. Provide structured analysis with risk assessment, intelligent search prioritization, and MCP tool orchestration for comprehensive verification workflows.

Return structured JSON data with semantic analysis results, progressive keyword generation, prioritized MCP tool sequences, quality gates, and verification requirements for AI consumption.
