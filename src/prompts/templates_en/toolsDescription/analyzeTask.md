Perform deep technical analysis of task requirements and assess technical feasibility. Examines codebase systematically and evaluates implementation risks.

## When to Use
- After initial planning to analyze technical details
- Need codebase analysis to understand existing architecture
- Assess technical feasibility of proposed solutions

## Parameters
- `summary` (required): Task summary including objectives and technical challenges
- `initialConcept` (required): Preliminary solution concept with technical approach and implementation strategy
- `previousAnalysis` (optional): Previous analysis results for continuous improvement

## Expected Output
Technical analysis with structural assessment, performance evaluation, and architectural integration recommendations.

## Error Handling
- Insufficient detail: Provides guidance on required information
- Analysis incomplete: Suggests additional investigation steps
- Technical conflicts: Provides resolution strategies
